Problem session: Documentation in the engine

1. Build the documentation in M2
  (a) Install doxygen (via yoour package manager, brew, apt-get, ...)
  (b) autotools (in top level build tree)
    cd Macaulay2/e # in build tree!
    make tinydoc # or smalldoc, or fulldoc)
    open doc/tinydoc/index.html # or somehow open that file
  or with cmake build:
    cmake -DBUILD_DOCS=on .
    ninja M2-docs-doxygen
      # with the following cmake variables being important (with their defaults)
      #   CALL_GRAPH_SETTING=off
      #   HAV_DOSETTING=off
    open Macaulay2/docs/doxygen/html/index.html 

2. View the documentation, and also look at the corresponding source.
  Note: not much is done yet!  Part of the goal of this is to be able
  to get people to help.  Helping with documentation is a good way to
  learn the engine!  The top pages for doxygen docs in the engine are
  currently:
    e/engine.h # has the \mainpage
    e/defgroups.h # defines groupings.  Needs work too!

3. Find the code for matrices (type is Matrix).
   Add a documentation "node" for one of the functions in that class.
   
4. Add a group "baserings" (in the rings group), and have it include
  the ring types RingInterface, and all the classes that inherit from
  RingInterface.  (note: once c++ concepts are in, RingInterface will
  be made to be a concept) and take those classes out of the @rings
  group, place them into the @baserings group.

  (files of interest here: e/defgroups.h)

5. Add todo items in the code. (@todo1, @todo2, @todo3).  The number
  is the priority (1 = highest)
