Hooks in Macaulay2

1. Find the github issue involving hooks
2. Find the code in Macaulay2/m2 that implements hooks
3. Find all uses of hooks in Macaulay2/m2 and
    Macaulay2/packages.
4. Reimplement runHooks so that the first non-null returned value is returned as the value.
    (currently runHooks depends on the various hooks calling 'break' to return their value)
    This should still work if a hook function does return its value via 'break'.
4a. Add a new version of runHooks which allows its function argument to be of the form opts -> arg -> (...).
5. Implement a listHooks function.
    If possible, display it as a vertical numbered list so that the 'code' function can be used to
    see the corresponding hook functions. (hints: see code for 'code', and NumberedVerticalList)
6. Reimplement the current uses of hooks in Macaulay2/m2 and Macaulay2/packages/
    (e.g. minimalPresentation, resolution, codim, syz, mingens (currently in LocalRings.m2)
7. Document these functions.
